# Rust REST API with Iron
Welcome to the Rust REST API with Iron project! This Rust application provides a simple RESTful API built using the Iron web framework. With the Rust REST API, users can create, read, update, and delete resources over HTTP, allowing for communication between clients and servers.

## Features
1. **RESTful Routing:** Implements RESTful routing for handling HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

2. **CRUD Operations:** Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources.

3. **JSON Serialization:** Serializes and deserializes data in JSON format for communication between clients and servers.

4. **Middleware Support:** Utilizes Iron's middleware architecture for adding additional functionality such as logging, authentication, or request/response processing.

5. **Error Handling:** Implements error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid requests or server errors.

6. **Modular Design:** Organizes code into reusable modules to promote maintainability and extensibility.

## Installation
To run the Rust REST API with Iron, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Rust_web_api.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Rust_web_api

3. **Build the Application:** Build the Rust binary for the REST API using Cargo, the Rust package manager:

cargo build --release

## Usage
1. **Start the Server:** Run the built binary to start the REST API server:

cargo run --release

2. **Send HTTP Requests**: Use a tool such as cURL, Postman, or a web browser to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

3. **Create Resources:** Send POST requests to create new resources, providing the necessary data in the request body.

4. **Read Resources:** Send GET requests to retrieve existing resources, specifying the resource identifier in the request URL.

5. **Update Resources:** Send PUT requests to update existing resources, providing the updated data in the request body.

6. **Delete Resources:** Send DELETE requests to delete existing resources, specifying the resource identifier in the request URL.

## Customization
1. **Route Configuration:** Customize route configuration to define additional endpoints or modify existing ones according to your API requirements.

2. **Middleware Integration:** Integrate additional middleware components to add functionality such as authentication, logging, or request/response processing.

3. **Data Handling:** Customize data handling logic to validate input, enforce business rules, or interact with external data sources.
